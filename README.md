# VR-Alien Hitting Game

This was a group project where I handled the coding/scripting part and achieved to build this game where the user is required to throw balls at the aliens (new ball keeps spawning every 5 seconds), and whenever the player hits an alien it falls down and gets destroyed. Every 20 seconds 3 new aliens will keep spawning.
